## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **structured SQL pipelines** can be used to perform **end-to-end business analytics**.
It builds a data warehouse-style schema, transforms raw data, and runs analytical queries to derive insights about **sales trends, customer performance, and category contributions**.

The project uses **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**, **Window Functions**, and **aggregations** to create clean, reusable SQL modules suitable for BI dashboards.

## 📂 Dataset Description

* **Data Model:** Star Schema
* **Files Included:** 8 SQL scripts for schema creation, data transformation, and insights generation

| Table           | Description                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `dim_customers` | Contains customer demographics and regional details |
| `dim_products`  | Product and category-level information              |
| `dim_date`      | Calendar dimension used for time-based analysis     |
| `fact_sales`    | Fact table containing transaction-level details     |

**Key Columns:**
`order_number`, `order_date`, `customer_key`, `product_key`, `sales_amount`, `quantity`

## 🏗️ SQL Workflow

```
00_init_database.sql          → Initialize database schema and load base tables
01_change_over_time_analysis.sql → Track trends in sales and customer growth
02_cumulative_analysis.sql     → Compute cumulative sales and running totals
03_performance_analysis.sql    → Compare performance across time periods
04_part_to_whole_analysis.sql  → Determine category & region contributions
05_data_segmentation.sql       → Segment customers by purchase behavior
06_data_segmentation(2).sql    → Refine segmentation into VIP/Regular/New
report_customers.sql / report_products.sql → Generate final summarized reports
```

## 🧰 Key SQL Techniques

✅ **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** – for modular query design
✅ **Window Functions** – for cumulative totals and rankings
✅ **Aggregate Functions** – for performance and contribution metrics
✅ **JOINs** – linking fact and dimension tables for insights
✅ **Segmentation Logic** – grouping customers by purchasing behavior
✅ **Date Functions** – handling YoY/MoM comparisons

## ▶️ How to Run This Project

### ✅ Requirements

Any SQL platform — **MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or SQLite**

### ⚙️ Steps

1. Run `00_init_database.sql` to create schema.
2. Execute each file in order (`01` → `06`).
3. Generate reports using:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM report_customers;
   SELECT * FROM report_products;
   ```

---

## 🧭 Outcome

This project showcases how **analytical SQL design** can be used to turn raw transactional data into structured, insight-rich reports —
a great demonstration of **data warehousing, business analysis, and SQL mastery**.
